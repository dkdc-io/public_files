## food

Blue Buffalo -- Adult -- Chicken and Brown Rice Recipe

~1 cup twice per day

Murphy will not overeat her own food and it can be left out. However, I tend to feed her twice per day to avoid any food aggression toward Nix.

## potty

Murphy should go out at least 3x/day -- morning, afternoon, and night.

## exercise

Murphy doesn't need too much exercise.
